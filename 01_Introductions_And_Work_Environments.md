## `Overview`

Today is the first class. We will go over the syllabus and talk about the course in general and what we expect to get out of it. I’ll introduce myself, talk about my previous and current work and answer any questions about what’s coming the rest of the semester. We will also start setting up our work environments for the rest of the course. We’ll do an overview of VS Code and its extensions, and of Git and Github as working methods and repositories. We’ll also start setting up a personal website that you will use to upload all your course work. In doing that we’ll introduce some of the main coding languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Finally, we’ll talk about the final class project.
