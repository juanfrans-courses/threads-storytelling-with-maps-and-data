## Overview

Today we will continue to develop the personal website. We will finish introducing HTML and CSS and create a draft page. Once this is done we will introduce Git and Github, creating a local repository for the site and pushing it to Github. Once there, we will create a `gh-pages` branch so the repository can work as a public website.

If we still have time, we will start learning how to build a web map with Mapbox as our main mapping library and provider of base maps.
