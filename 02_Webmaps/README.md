## Overview

Today we will continue to develop the personal website. We will finish introducing HTML and CSS and create a draft page. Once this is done we will introduce Git and Github, creating a local repository for the site and pushing it to Github. Once there, we will create a `gh-pages` branch so the repository can work as a public website.

If we still have time, we will start learning how to build a web map with Mapbox as our main mapping library and provider of base maps.

## Personal Site

## Summary

Today we will continue to work on web maps. This time around, we will add two types of data to the map: a polygon file with median household income, and a point file with subway station usage during the first weeks of Covid. We will learn how to add the layers, how to style the data and how to make them clickable. If we have time, we will also learn how to add a title and a legend to the map.

## Assignment

Find your own data that relates to your site and to your studio project and create an **interactive** web map displaying that data. The map should have title and legend and be clickable. Think about zoom levels, colors and popup windows. Add this map to your personal site as "Assignment 2" and add a description to the corresponding page.

## Rachael Dottle Presentation

Questions:

* What happens / how to prepare for data that is no longer available
* How do you learn / keep up / trouble shoot
* How do you choose a style / type of graph
* What do you highlight in a story / do you have a preferred narrative style
* What have you learned from journalism that you think architects & designers should know/use
* How do you create the final graphics for publication?
* How much do you let your users explore the data?

Notes:

* Process:
  * Idea
  * If it doesn't come with the data, make the data
  * Start sketching (tool agnostic) / exploring
  * "Data memo"
* Simplicity
* Even with a simple map, there's always a legend, scale bar and source
